the below pipeline would fix the issue of passing the environment variables

steps:

    uses: actions/checkout@v3

  # Create the `.env` file using the secret `ENV_FILE_CONTENT` added from GitHub repository secrets
  - name: Create .env file
    run: echo "${{ secrets.ENV_FILE_CONTENT }}" > .env

  # Build the Docker image
  - name: Build Docker image
    run: docker build -t my-app .
